INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT:
The project is developed on the basis of providing various options to the user (menu driven program) from which they need to select any one at a time. The options available are Numerology, Shopping and a Quiz.

Numerology:
It is the first part of my project. Numerology is a branch which deals with numbers and talks about the characteristics and future of a person. In this option, one would be able to determine its zodiac sign, their outward expression and their life path.
Shopping:
It is the second part of my project. In this option, people will be able to shop in a plaza in which there is a Peter England and a Levi’s showroom.
Quiz:
It is the last part of my project. In this option, people can choose which quiz they are interested to play. They can choose options from sports, food, drink or play a mixed bag of questions.

I have used only a main method in my project. It is the one in the class named Project. I have also used static methods in my project so it is easy to access the other classes from the Project class.
